## Settings

The plugin provides a settings tab under the Obsidian settings menu:

- **Show Editor Context Menu Item**: Toggle the display of the editor context menu items.

## About encrypted string of Evernote

Evernote makes the encrypted data with reserved starting value: `ENC0`.

This results in the encrypted data starting with `RU5DM`.

Therefore, you can find the encrypted data by searching `RU5DM` in the note.

If the encrypted data is not starting with `RU5DM`, it could be a old encrypted data with RC2 encryption, which is not supported,
or it could be corrupted data.

By **Format all Evernote secrets in the note** command,
all strings starting with `RU5DM` in the note will be formatted as the Evernote secret format.

If the string is in the code block (including inline code block),
bold, italic, or strikethrough, it will not be formatted.
